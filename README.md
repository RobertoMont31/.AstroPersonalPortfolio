# Hellow there!

##I'm Roberto Montufar and this is my portfolio

As I said, This is my personal portfolio, I created it using Astro, Tailwind CSS, spiced it with some other packages and other cool stuff I found along the way for creating it, most of my inspiration abour design comes from some of the projects [here](https://astro.build/showcase/),  you can check out the deployed site [here](https://robmontufar-dev.netlify.app/)

This is mostly a compilation of my work experience, the technologies I know/used, a little snapshot about myself, projects and any other thing I think you should know to have a complete picture of me as a developer. Hope you like it.
